# Mining
Where/how to mine the Opioid (OID) coin

# Cause
If you plan on solo mining OID, it is recommended sending 10% per block as per our Code of Conduct. Remember 10% of each block reward is deamed as a cause fee. Out of 10%, 5% goes toward our treatment partners and 5% toward our team. 

# Respect
We recommend you mine at any of these available pool(s) as the 10% fee comes out automatically. If you plan on setting up your own pool, please go to -> https://github.com/OidLife/Pools.
