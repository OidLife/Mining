# Mining
Where/how to mine the Opioid (OID) coin

# Cause
If you plan on solo mining OID, it is recommended sending 10% per block as per our Code of Conduct. Remember 10% of each block
reward is deamed as a cause fee. Out of 10%, 5% goes toward our treatment partners and 5% toward our team. 

# Respect
We recommend you mine at any of these available pool(s). The 10% fee comes out automatically. 

# Pool(s)
(You may submit your pool info to us by going to -> https://oid.life/submitMyPool. Please adhere to our Code of Conduct when running a pool. Find the Code of Conduct -> https://github.com/OidLife/Conduct.)

website stats -> https://oidpool.com

Stratum Pool ports (point your miner to):

```oidpool.com:3008``` 8 dif
```oidpool.com:3032``` 32 dif
```oidpool.com:3256``` 256 dif

Format your OID wallet address with a worker name -> oid_wallet_address.workername

E.g ```DPpyxuy6eJVyDaHJAcbEnJwNZtRVdPMdgn.rig1```
